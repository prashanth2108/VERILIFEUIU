Note:
-In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once.
-Always start component names with a capital letter.React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags.<Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
-you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.
- A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.
-Props are Read-Only: All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
